## ‚ú® Features

- **Tri-Provider AI Engine**: Choose between Google's `imagen-4.0`, Stability AI's `Stable Diffusion XL`, or Hugging Face's `stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0`.
- **Magic Prompt**: Intelligently expand a simple idea into a rich, descriptive prompt with a single click, powered by Gemini.
- **Negative Prompts**: Fine-tune your creations by specifying what to exclude from the image (Gemini-exclusive feature).
- **Smart Failover**: If the primary model (Gemini) hits a quota limit, the app automatically switches to a fallback provider (Stability AI) to ensure uninterrupted creativity.
- **Aspect Ratio Control**: Generate images in square (1:1), portrait (3:4), or landscape (16:9) formats with the Gemini model.
- **Persistent Image Library**: All your generated images are saved in your browser's local storage. Review, download, or delete your creations at any time.
- **Client-Side Focused**: Runs directly in the browser, making it easy to deploy on any static hosting platform.
- **Multi-API Key Management**: A clean, tabbed settings modal allows you to securely save your Google, Stability AI, and Hugging Face API keys.
- **A+ Content Mockup**: Automatically generate an e-commerce-ready "A+ Content" mockup from your generated image.
- **Sleek, Responsive UI**: A modern interface with light and dark modes, designed to work beautifully on any device.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) (with TypeScript)
- **AI Providers**: 
    - [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/)
    - [Stability AI API (ClipDrop)](https://clipdrop.co/apis)
    - [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Deployment**: Any static web host (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later)
- A Google API Key for Gemini
- A Stability AI (ClipDrop) API Key
- A Hugging Face User Access Token (API Key)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/wesai-image-generator.git
    cd wesai-image-generator
    ```

2.  **Get your API Keys:**
    - **Google Gemini:** Get your key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/).
    - **Stability AI:** Get your key from the [ClipDrop API dashboard](https://clipdrop.co/apis).
    - **Hugging Face:** Get your key from your [Hugging Face account settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

3.  **Run the application:**
    This project is set up to run in a development environment like AI Studio. Once running, click the "Settings" icon in the top right corner to enter and save your API keys in their respective tabs. Keys are stored only in your browser's local storage.

4.  **Start generating!**
    With the keys saved, you can now select a model, enter a prompt, and generate images.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This application communicates directly with the Google, Stability AI, and Hugging Face APIs from the client-side.

-   When you enter your API keys, they are saved securely in your browser's `localStorage`.
-   When you submit a prompt, the application sends a `fetch` request to the selected API provider, including your prompt and the corresponding API key.
-   The API returns an image, which is then converted into a data URL and displayed on the page.
-   The smart failover logic provides a seamless experience by automatically retrying with an alternate provider if a quota error is detected.
