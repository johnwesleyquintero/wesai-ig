## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later)
- A Hugging Face User Access Token (API Key).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/wesai-image-generator.git
    cd wesai-image-generator
    ```

2.  **Get your Hugging Face API Key:**
    - Go to your Hugging Face profile settings: [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
    - Create a new User Access Token with the "read" role. This will be your API key.

3.  **Run the application:**
    This project is set up to run in a development environment like AI Studio. Once running, click the "Settings" icon in the top right corner to enter and save your Hugging Face API key. The key will be stored in your browser's local storage for future visits.

4.  **Start generating!**
    With the key saved, you can now enter a prompt and generate images.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This application communicates directly with the Hugging Face Inference API from the client-side (your browser).

-   When you enter your API key, it is saved securely in your browser's `localStorage`.
-   When you submit a prompt, the application sends a `fetch` request to the Hugging Face API, including your prompt and the API key in the authorization header.
-   The API returns an image blob, which is then converted into a data URL and displayed on the page.

This client-side approach simplifies deployment, as there is no backend to manage.
